### 3. **Create a Branch**

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. This helps keep changes organized and makes it easier to manage pull requests.

_Replace `your-feature-name` with a descriptive name for the feature or fix you're working on (e.g., `feature/add-gradient-tool` or `bugfix/fix-theme-persistence`)._

### 4. **Make Changes**

Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them with a meaningful message. Use a consistent and clear commit message format that follows the **Conventional Commit Guidelines**.

Example commit message formats:

- `feat: add gradient customization tool`
- `fix: resolve theme persistence issue`
- `docs: update contributing guidelines`

To commit your changes, use the following commands:
